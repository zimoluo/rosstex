`rosstex.cls` file defines a series of behavior based on `amsart` class.

* Sections are now rearranged as Problems, while the Appendix remains the same.
* Builtin environment for Theorem, Lemma, Corollary, Definition, and more.
* `\title` is not necessarily defined. Instead, a variable named `psetnum` gives you the option to directly input the number of the problem set. The title will then be automatically formulated as `Problem Set #{psetnum}`.
* Ross Program logo in the background!
